                Hey, my name is Khoury. I'm a Software Engineer. I love Call of Duty, and if I use the shotgun you won't have a chance. Once upon a time I thought, I was going to be a professional football player. Obviously that didn't happen but I'd bet that I am the fastest developer you ever met. We can race at anytime!

				As a Frontend Developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world.
